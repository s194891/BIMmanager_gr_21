What else do you still need to learn?
how you might use OpenBIM in the future?

At the beggining we had only prior experienxe with modelling in software such as Revit, Rhino/grasshopper and autocad. We had the role as managers, so we skipped the analyst step and jumped directly to being BIM managers. Because of this, we might be less likely to use OpenBim in the future as a result of less programming during the course. However we saw alot of different use cases from our analyst gruops and strenghtened our genereal management skills as well as GitHub skills.

One use case we are consiterating is to calculate the concrete volumes for onsite slab pours as a lot of waste is currently going on with sending back or calling in extra trucks when the amound of concrete is estimated wrong. To achive this, we must first strengten our OpenBim programming skills, further.   

# Your process of developing the tutorial
Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
Its nice to know that large amounts of data on building can easily be optained, should our thesis require it. 

Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
No, it was nice to be able to make a totourial about what we specificly learned (gitHub skills), though it was a bit confusing what the toutorial should be about in the beginning. 

Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
The number of tools was ok. 

Did the tool address the use case you identified?
as managers our A3 tool, ended up being a document of feedback to our analyst groups on their tools.

### are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
It depents on what my thesis is going to be about, but I think it will be more usefull in the advanced building design when we are going to be many people working on differnet models. This will help us figure out what those MEP guys are going and how it might effect my model.

### are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
On site to do more simple analysis of amounts of stuff in models because many in the constructuion industri are unfamilier with the simplest IT-tools. Which puts greater pressure on to automate stuff for them as we who know don't want to spen all day looking up manual things for them. 

### conclude the journey through A1-A5
It has deffenetly been a jearny, as the cousre has been vary loose. Getting the confidense form seeing out analyst gorups apriciating our work has motevated me into trying to get some resembelence of structure into the course fx. the Time table we produced to show everyone when to do what and internal deadlines for us to give them feedback in time to acturrly change stuff.

I was reluctant at first to be a manager, but i ended up enjoyng it very much. It feels very meaningful to help people navigate the course easier. 
I hope i can use openBim in my proffesinal life, as i would like to do more with coding and data analasys.
