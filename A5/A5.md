Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended
What else do you still need to learn?
how you might use OpenBIM in the future?

At the beggining we had only prior experienxe with modelling in software such as Revit, Rhino/grasshopper and autocad. We had the role as managers, so we skipped the analyst step and jumped directly to being BIM managers. Because of this, we might be less likely to use OpenBim in the future as a result of less programming during the course. However we saw alot of different use cases from our analyst gruops and strenghtened our genereal management skills as well as GitHub skills.

One use case we are consiterating is to calculate the concrete volumes for onsite slab pours as a lot of waste is currently going on with sending back or calling in extra trucks when the amound of concrete is estimated wrong. To achive this, we must first strengten our OpenBim programming skills, further.   

# Your process of developing the tutorial
Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
Its nice to know that large amounts of data on building can easily be optained, should our thesis require it. 

Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
No, it was nice to be able to make a totourial about what we specificly learned (gitHub skills), though it was a bit confusing what the toutorial should be about in the beginning. 

Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
The number of tools was ok. 

Did the tool address the use case you identified?
as managers our A3 tool, ended up being a document of feedback to our analyst groups on their tools. 

# Idividual reflections, s194891
are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
conclude the journey through A1-A5
I was reluctant at first to be a manager, but i ended up enjoyng it very much. It feels very meaningful to help people navigate the course easier. 
I hope i can use openBim in my proffesinal life, as i would like to do more with coding and data analasys.
