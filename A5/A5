# Gr 21

Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended :
What else do you still need to learn?
how you might use OpenBIM in the future?

Your process of developing the tutorial

Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
